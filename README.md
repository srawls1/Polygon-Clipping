# Polygon-Clipping

I developed this for my graphics class. Left click at points to choose the vertices of a polygon, and right-click to choose the last one. Each polygon can have up to 8 vertices, and you can draw up to 10 polygons. They are drawn using scan line conversion. Press the c key to enter clipping mode, where you click and drag to create a clipping window and clip the polygons to only show inside the rectangle.
